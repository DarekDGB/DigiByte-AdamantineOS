## Unreleased — Milestone 19: Final Release Gate, Tag Readiness, and Evidence Lock

**Status:** Final gate passed — approval update prepared, awaiting final copied-repo verification before tag command  
**Type:** Release-gate evidence, tag-readiness decision, and proof-pack indexing  
**Compatibility:** No package rename, no import-path change, no version bump, and no AdamantineOS tag

Milestone 19 is the final gate before any AdamantineOS tag decision. It verifies the release-gate document, tag-decision boundary, and final proof-pack index for the candidate `v3.0.0` release.

Current decision state:

```text
Candidate tag: v3.0.0
Tag approved: yes, after final copied-repo verification
Release approved: yes, after final copied-repo verification
Version bump applied: no
AdamantineOS remains: untagged until final copied-repo verification
```

Final verification after Milestone 19 gate package copy-back:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q
925 passed
100.00% coverage
TOTAL 4097 statements, 0 missed
```

Milestone 19 final gate passed after maintainer copy-back, fresh post-copy ZIP inspection, repeated tests, 100.00% coverage, and explicit tag approval. This approval update must be copied back and verified from one final fresh ZIP before the tag command is run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Unreleased — Milestone 18: Authorized Red-Team Review, Runtime Authority Wiring, and Fail-Closed Hardening

**Status:** Complete — fourth red-team passed; N8/N7 no-debt closure verified
**Type:** Runtime authority wiring, red-team fixes, and fail-closed hardening
**Compatibility:** No package rename, no import-path change, no version bump, and no AdamantineOS tag

Milestone 18 accepts and fixes the validated Claude AI red-team findings F1-F8, second-review findings N1/N2, third-review residual N1/N7/N8 notes, and closes with no known red-team technical debt carried forward.

Hardening added in the Milestone 18 hardening:

1. The live runtime path now invokes the final AdamantineOS policy engine before executor execution.
2. Cross-evidence context binding is enforced at the final policy engine when an expected context hash is supplied.
3. Truthy upstream `final_approval` attempts fail closed as authority bypass.
4. Hard DENY dominates human-review signals.
5. Hidden-authority scanning covers mapping, list, tuple, set, `__dict__`, and `__slots__` evidence.
6. Human-review detection requires exact status equality rather than substring matching.
7. Unknown evidence-supplied reason IDs are sanitized to `UNKNOWN_EXTERNAL_REASON` at the engine/runtime boundary.

Verification before maintainer copy-back:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q
925 passed
100.00% coverage
```


Additional no-debt closure hardening after Claude's fourth review:

8. N8 fixed: reject branches now fail closed if the final policy engine unexpectedly returns ALLOW inside an already-rejected runtime branch.
9. N7 closed: EQC aggregate runtime policy verdicts are explicitly documented as flowing through the stable `wallet_policy` local gate.

Milestone 18 is complete after fresh ZIP inspection and CI verification. AdamantineOS remains v2.2.0 and untagged; Milestone 19 remains pending as the final release gate.


Final external closure report archived:

```text
docs/RED_TEAM/ADAMANTINEOS_MILESTONE_18_FINAL_CLOSURE_REVIEW.docx
```

Claude AI final closure verdict: `PASS - Milestone 18 can be closed`. No known red-team note is carried forward as technical debt. This does not authorize release or tagging; Milestone 19 remains the final release gate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Milestone 17: Rebrand, Proof Pack, and Docs Alignment

**Status:** Complete  
**Type:** Documentation, release evidence, and public identity alignment  
**Compatibility:** No package rename, no import-path change, no version bump, and no AdamantineOS tag

Milestone 17 performs a controlled public identity alignment from **DigiByte Adamantine Wallet OS** to **DigiByte AdamantineOS** and adds the Level 4 integration proof-pack structure before authorized red-team review.

Locked rules:

1. `DigiByte AdamantineOS` is the public project name going forward.
2. `AdamantineOS` is the short project name going forward.
3. Package names, import paths, repository path assumptions, and release version remain unchanged.
4. AdamantineOS remains `v2.2.0` and untagged until Milestones 17, 18, and 19 are complete and verified.
5. Milestone 17 does not create new authority paths or weaken any fail-closed boundary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Unreleased - Milestone 18 second red-team hardening pass

- Fixed second-review N1 by replacing unconditional synthetic runtime evidence on the v2 final-policy path with evidence normalized only after real runtime boundaries accept Shield, Q-ID, Adaptive Core oracle, WSQK authority, EQC, and TVA/replay checks.
- Fixed second-review N2 by routing the legacy v1 executor path through final policy engine gating before executor execution.
- Updated runtime adapter guidance so integrators do not route live execution around the final policy engine.
- Added regression tests proving a live EQC deny reaches the final policy engine and that v1 execution is blocked when final policy denies.
- AdamantineOS remained v2.2.0 and untagged; this pass was superseded by fourth-review Option 2 closure.

## v2.2.0 — WSQK v2 Quantum-Aware Upgrade

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Quantum-aware authority upgrade  
**Compatibility:** Additive — legacy/v1 paths remain compatible unless WSQK v2 is explicitly required

This release upgrades WSQK inside AdamantineOS into a quantum-aware authority layer. WSQK v2 is now contract-defined, deterministically issued, reason-ID mapped, Truth Vector Authority (TVA) enforced, Q-ID posture bound, orchestrator propagated, and regression locked.

### What's locked:

1. WSQK v2 Authority Contract
   - `WSQKAuthorityV2` and `WSQKIssueRequestV2` defined
   - Required evidence families locked as a sorted canonical unique set
   - Deterministic `proof_bindings_hash` semantics sealed

2. Quantum-Aware Issuance and Reason IDs
   - Deterministic WSQK v2 issuer added
   - Stable reason IDs locked for malformed posture, invalid evidence families, unknown families, and binding failures
   - Fail-closed validation preserved

3. Truth Vector Authority (TVA) Enforcement
   - TVA enforces WSQK v2 posture requirements
   - Tampered proof binding hashes are denied before nonce use
   - WSQK v1 cannot satisfy explicit WSQK v2 requirements

4. Q-ID Hybrid Posture Binding
   - Hybrid-required posture requires classical AND PQC Q-ID posture
   - PQC-required posture requires PQC evidence
   - Posture mismatches deterministically deny

5. Orchestrator / Runtime Boundary Propagation
   - WSQK v2 requirements propagate through the runtime boundary
   - No silent v1 fallback when v2 is required
   - Downgrade attempts are regression locked

6. Tamperproof Regression Locks and Proof Pack
   - Negative-first tests cover hash tampering, context tampering, family drift, downgrade attempts, and Q-ID posture tamper
   - WSQK v2 proof pack maps contract → invariants → implementation → tests → CI proof
   - 100% coverage gate remains enforced

Rule: Any semantic change to WSQK v2 authority, proof binding, Q-ID posture binding, or TVA/orchestrator enforcement requires a new versioned compatibility lock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v2.1.0 — AC v3 Governance Compatibility Lock

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Compatibility lock (Adaptive Core v3 governance path sealed)  
**Compatibility:** Additive — no production behavior changes

This release locks AdamantineOS compatibility with Adaptive Core v3 `upgrade_proposal_v3` artifacts and seals the first cross-repository governance evaluation path.

### What's locked:

1. Adaptive Core v3 Governance Compatibility
   - Proven compatibility with Adaptive Core v3 `upgrade_proposal_v3` artifacts
   - Stable proposal ingestion and validation path
   - Deterministic evaluation of governance proposals

2. Cross-Repository Hash Invariant
   - Deterministic `proposal_hash` invariant enforced across repositories
   - Hash drift fails CI
   - Canonical compatibility vector frozen

3. Governance Receipt Path Frozen
   - Compatibility vectors frozen in CI (`approve` + receipt path)
   - First upgrade proposal review path sealed end-to-end
   - Stable review receipt artifact boundary

4. Boundary Guarantees Reinforced
   - No production behavior changes
   - Governance compatibility locked without expanding runtime trust
   - Strengthened boundary between proposal artifacts and execution behavior

Rule: Any semantic change to Adaptive Core v3 governance artifact handling requires a new versioned compatibility lock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v2.0.1 — Sealed Foundation (100% CI Enforcement)

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Integrity lock (coverage enforcement hardening)  
**Compatibility:** No functional or protocol changes

This release seals the AdamantineOS v2.0.x foundation by enforcing a strict 100% coverage regression gate in CI.

### What's locked:

1. Coverage Policy Hardened
   - `--cov-fail-under` raised from 95% to 100%
   - CI fails on any uncovered execution path
   - No tolerance margin

2. Runtime Surface Included
   - All runtime layers included in coverage scope
   - No coverage omit rules
   - No hidden escape paths

3. Regression Integrity Reinforced
   - 493 tests passing

Rule: Any uncovered execution path will fail CI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v2.0.0 — Runtime Host v2 + Execution Boundary Seal

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Major release (runtime host + execution_response_v2 seal)  
**Compatibility:** Breaking — execution response upgraded to v2 contract

This release seals the mobile runtime host (v2) and locks deterministic execution behavior end-to-end.

### What's locked:

1. Runtime Host v2
   - `run_mobile_execution_call_v2` as authoritative execution entrypoint
   - Deterministic policy injection
   - Strict nonce store enforcement

   - response_allow.json
   - response_deny.json
   - response_hostile_context_mismatch.json
   - Canonical SHA256 manifest lock
   - Strict fixture-set exact-match enforcement

4. Determinism Enforcement
   - 50-run replay determinism tests (allow + hostile)
   - Stable canonical JSON dumps
   - CI fails on any payload drift

5. Fail-Closed Guarantees Reinforced
   - Adapter structural violations -> deterministic deny
   - Manifest drift -> CI failure
   - Canonical hash mismatch -> CI failure

Rule: Any change to execution_response_v2 shape requires a new major version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v1.5.0 — Mobile Contract v2 + Conformance Freeze

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Contract extension (mobile v2 freeze + deterministic conformance pack)  
**Compatibility:** Additive — v1.4.x contracts remain valid unless mobile v2 is explicitly used

Rule: Any change to mobile request/response shape requires a major version bump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v1.4.0 — Q-ID Linkage Hardened (Replay Proof Gate)

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Contract hardening (Q-ID binding + replay-proof validation)  
**Compatibility:** Additive — legacy/v1.3 proof packs remain valid unless policy enables the latch

This release locks:

- Q-ID replay proof contract (`QIDReplayProof`) and deterministic adapter validation
- Distinct reason IDs for missing/invalid replay proof and binding mismatches
- Policy latch `require_qid_replay_proof` (deny-by-default; opt-in hardening)
- OS Proof Pack v1_4_0 fixtures + manifest lock (allow + fail-closed deny cases)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v1.3.0 — Shield Interfaces Frozen + Posture Locked

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Contract hardening (Shield v3 + posture + regression locks)  
**Compatibility:** Additive only — response adds `protection_mode` and new strict fixtures

This release freezes the Shield v3 external evidence interface and locks deterministic, auditable posture outputs.

1. Shield v3 Strict Interface Freeze  
2. Protection Mode Output (auditable)  
3. No Silent Downgrade (policy posture latches)  
4. Regression Locks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v1.2.0 — Integration Harness Sealed

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Deterministic integration freeze (execution proof pack)  
**Compatibility:** Additive only — contracts unchanged

This release seals the deterministic integration harness for AdamantineOS.

Seal Statement:

As of v1.2.0, the execution integration layer is cryptographically reproducible and CI-enforced.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## v1.0.0 — Foundation Sealed

**Status:** Locked  
**Type:** Foundation seal (contracts + deterministic reasoning + boundaries)  
**Compatibility:** Additive changes only beyond this point

This release seals the AdamantineOS foundation.

Breaking changes require a new major version.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Unreleased - Milestone 18 Option 2 full evidence-level wiring pass

- Kept Milestone 18 open after Claude AI third confirmation found residual N1 scope.
- Selected Option 2 instead of accepting residual synthetic/aggregate-only evidence scope.
- Routed Q-ID, Q-ID replay, Adaptive Core oracle, Shield, WSQK, TVA/replay, human gate, and EQC denial classes into `evaluate_final_policy_engine` before executor execution.
- Added regression tests proving Q-ID, Shield, WSQK, replay, and human gate failures reach the final policy engine and do not execute.
- Preserved `v2.2.0`, package/import names, and untagged status.
